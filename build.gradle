// NOTE: The real build files are under tools/gradle/ to keep the repo root tidy.
// To build/run examples using Gradle, either install Gradle and run the gradlew delegator
// in the repository root, or invoke the scripts in examples/.

// For advanced usage, run:
//    ./gradlew runParseExample
// which delegates to the tools/gradle build implementation.
